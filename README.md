# Decentralized NFT Access Manager (DNAM)

## Overview

The Decentralized NFT Access Manager (DNAM) is a Solidity-based smart contract system designed to manage access to NFT launches, 
pre-sales, or any other exclusive content in a decentralized, secure, and efficient manner using Merkle Trees for whitelisting. 
The system aims to provide NFT builders with a tool to create an exclusive experience for their early 
supporters or any designated group, ensuring that only whitelisted addresses can mint or purchase NFTs 
during the early stages of a launch.

## Key Features

1. **Merkle Tree Whitelisting**: Utilize Merkle Trees to efficiently verify whether an address is part of the whitelist without revealing the entire list on-chain, thus ensuring privacy and reducing gas costs.

2. **Dynamic Whitelist Management**: Enable NFT project owners to dynamically update the whitelist by deploying a new Merkle Tree root to the smart contract, catering for last-minute changes or additional rounds of whitelisting.

3. **OG Supporter Rewards**: Implement a system that allows for different tiers within the whitelist, such as OG supporters, who may receive additional benefits like reduced minting costs, access to special editions, or higher purchase limits.

4. **Decentralized Verification**: Allow users to verify their whitelisting status through a decentralized interface, providing transparency and trust in the whitelisting process.

5. **Compatibility and Integration**: Design the DNAM to be easily integrated with existing NFT projects or platforms on Ethereum, ensuring broad usability and appeal.

6. **Anti-Sybil Mechanism**: Incorporate mechanisms to limit the impact of Sybil attacks, where one user tries to claim multiple spots on the whitelist by using different addresses.


## TODO:

- [ ] Deploy the contract to an EVM-compatible chain, 
- [ ] Fetch the contract ABI
- [ ] Use `abigen` to create Go bindings. 
- [ ] Write a simple client to interact with the contract.
- [ ] Create a UI for the Go client.
